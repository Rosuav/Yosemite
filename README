The Yosemite project grew out of a plan to maintain and manage a collection of
Looney Tunes videos, and is now a more generic manager for videos.

Currently written for Python 2.

Requires a config file, config.py; see two examples in the repository.

Tested on Windows XP, and Debian and Ubuntu Linux; the basic script will run
on pretty much any platform, but communication with a video player may require
some tweaking.
